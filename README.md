# hatspace

With HATSpace we aim to explore and address various pain points related to the current property renting process in Australia. We want to provide tenants, home owners and agents with tools to simplify their processes and create visibilities with every steps involved. We want to create an environment where everyone collaborate, is treated fairly and protected under the law. With HATspace, everyone is a winner!
